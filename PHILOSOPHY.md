# Philosophy & Mission

## The Democratic Crisis

Modern representative democracy faces a structural problem: **electoral aristocracy**.

When we elect representatives, we systematically empower:
- Those with wealth (campaign funding)
- Professional politicians (career advantage)
- Party elites (organizational control)
- The already powerful (name recognition)

As Étienne Chouard argues: *"Ce n'est pas aux hommes au pouvoir d'écrire les règles du pouvoir"* (Those in power should not write the rules of power).

Elections create a political class that serves itself more than citizens.

## The Alternative: Sortition

**Sortition** = Random selection of citizens for governance roles (like jury duty for democracy)

### Historical Precedent
Ancient Athens used sortition for 200 years:
- Most public offices filled by lottery
- Short terms (1 year typical)
- Citizens rotated through governance
- Created true political equality

### Why Sortition Works
1. **Produces Equals** - No hierarchy, no professional politicians
2. **Prevents Lying** - Can't campaign on false promises
3. **Eliminates Party Control** - No need for party machines
4. **Enables Citizen Oversight** - Those not selected watch those who are
5. **Forces Deliberation** - Can't rely on pre-existing positions

### Modern Implementation
- Citizen assemblies (Ireland, France)
- Policy juries (Germany, Netherlands)  
- Participatory budgeting (Porto Alegre, Paris)
- Constitutional conventions (Iceland)

## Constituant's Role

We're not building *another* voting platform. We're building a **training ground for sortition-based democracy**.

### Three-Phase Strategy

#### Phase 1: TRANSPARENCY (Current)
**Message**: "See what your representatives are voting on"

**Purpose**: 
- Make legislative process visible
- Show gap between citizen and representative votes
- Build user base and trust

**Result**: Citizens become informed about real legislation

#### Phase 2: ACCOUNTABILITY (Years 2-3)
**Message**: "Your representatives work for you - let's remind them"

**Purpose**:
- Create pressure for alignment
- Enable petitions and amendments
- Track representative performance

**Result**: Electoral democracy functions *better* (but still flawed)

#### Phase 3: TRANSFORMATION (Year 3+)
**Message**: "What if YOU were the legislator?"

**Purpose**:
- Simulate constituent assemblies
- Run sortition experiments
- Train citizens in deliberation
- Demonstrate capability

**Result**: Proof that ordinary citizens can govern effectively

### The Long Game

Constituant is not just about transparency or accountability. It's about demonstrating that:

1. **Citizens CAN govern** when given proper information and deliberation space
2. **Random selection works** - diverse groups deliberate better than partisan elites
3. **Training matters** - practice improves civic capability
4. **Alternatives exist** - sortition is viable for modern societies

We're building capability and demand for a fundamental change in how democracy works.

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Transparency
- Open source code (AGPL-3.0)
- Public aggregate statistics
- Auditable processes
- No hidden algorithms

**Why**: Trust cannot be assumed, it must be earned through transparency.

### 2. Privacy by Design
- Anonymous voting by default
- Data minimization
- GDPR compliance
- Individual verification available

**Why**: Coercion and surveillance are weapons against democracy.

### 3. Citizen Sovereignty
- No corporate ownership
- Association loi 1901 (non-profit)
- Community governance
- Fork-able codebase

**Why**: Democratic tools must be democratically controlled.

### 4. Inclusive by Default
- Low barrier to entry
- No technical requirements
- Multiple participation levels
- Educational resources

**Why**: Democracy requires broad participation, not elite selection.

### 5. Evidence-Based Evolution
- Track what works
- Adapt based on data
- Experiment carefully
- Document learnings

**Why**: We're pioneering new democratic forms - humility required.

## The Name: "Constituant"

In French, **constituant** has two meanings:

1. **Un constituant** - A constituent, a voter, a member of a constituency
2. **Constituant(e)** - Constitution-making, founding, constituent (as in "assemblée constituante")

The name reflects our dual purpose:
- Serve today's constituents (voters)
- Train tomorrow's constituants (constitution-makers)

*"Nous sommes tous constituants"* - We are all capable of constitutional deliberation when properly equipped.

## Addressing Concerns

### "This could be manipulated!"
**Response**: Any tool can be misused. Our defense:
- Open source (auditable)
- Transparent algorithms (no manipulation possible)
- Privacy protection (prevents coercion)
- Community governance (no single point of control)
- Fork-able (can't be captured)

### "Direct democracy is mob rule!"
**Response**: We're not proposing direct democracy. We're proposing:
- Representative democracy with sortition instead of elections
- Deliberative processes, not referendums
- Training and information, not uninformed snap judgments
- Diverse representation, not majority tyranny

### "Citizens aren't qualified!"
**Response**: 
- Neither are elected officials (no special training required)
- Diversity produces better decisions than homogeneous elites
- Deliberation improves judgment (studies show this)
- Current system clearly failing - time to try alternatives

### "This is utopian!"
**Response**:
- Sortition worked for 200 years in Athens
- Modern experiments show promise (citizen assemblies)
- Ireland used sortition for constitutional reform
- We're testing incrementally, not gambling on revolution

## Measurement & Success

### How do we know if this works?

#### Phase 1 Metrics
- **Engagement**: Active users, votes cast, return rate
- **Quality**: Discussion depth, informed voting patterns
- **Gap Identification**: Divergence between citizen/representative votes
- **Trust**: User surveys, platform credibility

#### Phase 2 Metrics
- **Accountability**: Representative responses to petitions
- **Influence**: Policy changes linked to platform data
- **Media**: Coverage of citizen-representative gaps
- **Partnerships**: Civic organizations adopting platform

#### Phase 3 Metrics
- **Deliberation Quality**: Reasoned arguments, changed minds
- **Sortition Success**: Random panels produce good decisions
- **Capability**: Citizens demonstrate legislative competence
- **Demand**: Public support for sortition-based reforms

### What would constitute failure?

1. Platform used for manipulation or propaganda
2. Captured by political parties or corporations
3. Worsens polarization instead of enabling deliberation
4. Excludes marginalized voices
5. No measurable impact on democratic quality

If these occur, we adapt or shut down. **Do no harm** is the first principle.

## The Bigger Picture

Constituant is one small experiment in a global movement toward:
- **Deliberative democracy** (citizens councils, assemblies)
- **Participatory democracy** (budgeting, planning)
- **Liquid democracy** (delegative voting)
- **Quadratic voting** (preference intensity)
- **Sortition governance** (random selection)

We don't know which models will work best. We need to **experiment carefully** and **learn quickly**.

### Why Now?

1. **Technology**: Digital tools enable large-scale coordination
2. **Crisis**: Trust in institutions at historic lows
3. **Evidence**: Citizen assemblies showing promise
4. **Opportunity**: People seeking democratic alternatives
5. **Urgency**: Existential challenges require collective action

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- **Honesty**: Admit mistakes, show limitations
- **Humility**: Listen to users, adapt to evidence
- **Integrity**: Resist capture, maintain independence  
- **Quality**: Build reliable tools, not flashy gimmicks
- **Service**: Serve democracy, not ourselves

This is not a business. This is a civic duty.
